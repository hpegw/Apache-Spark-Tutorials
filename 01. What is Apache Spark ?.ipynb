    "- One of the largest advantages of tight integration is the ability to build applications that seamlessly combine different processing models.\n",
    "    > Eg: In Spark you can write one application that uses machine learning to classify data in real time as it is ingested from streaming sources. Simultaneously, analysts can query the resulting data, also in real time, via SQL"
